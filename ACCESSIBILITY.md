# Accessibility Policy of The Turing Way Community

Within _The Turing Way_ community, we define accessibility practices as a set of community-wide, behavioral, social, and technical decisions that can be taken to ensure that all are welcome and are able to enter and participate in research, data-driven processes, communities and events despite any barriers for access.

While accessibility is commonly understood with respect to disability, we – meaning _The Turing Way_ community – define accessibility as giving access to groups of people that encounter different barriers for participation. Barriers may be anything related to, including, and extending beyond the following: 
- Age
- Disability
- Ethnicity and race
- Family
- Language (written and/or spoken)
- Geography
- Nationality
- Religion, faith and belief
- Sex and gender
- Sexual orientation
- Socioeconomic status
- Technical or disciplinary background

We recognise the complex and interlinking ways in which intersectionality affects identity, and thereby, access or inclusion within any community project like _The Turing Way_. So in this sense, our accessibility practices may overlap with practices that enable inclusion more broadly within any community.

In developing this policy, we aim to draw from the [access-centered framework](https://accesscenteredmovement.com/what-access-centered-means/) in describing access as a constant process that changes in each space with each individual. Therefore, while this policy outlines our commitment to access-centered practices within our community in a broad sense, we also document the specific practices we use within _The Turing Way_ our Community Handbook, as well as share broader recommendations that go beyond our current practices in the Guide for Accessibility. Each resource (our Accessibility Policy - this document, Community Handbook Accessibility Guidelines, and our Accessibility Guide) play a different yet overlapping role in enabling, documenting, and sharing our evolving language around accessible and inclusive collaboration.

This policy is a work in progress, as are the practices that we employ as a community. Much like how _The Turing Way_ itself is always being written and rewritten, our accessibility policies and practices are constantly being updated as broader awareness grows and changes in technology are made.

## 1.1 Core Principles

These core principles are at the heart of our accessibility policy, and they extend beyond the web accessibility of our open access guides (see 2.1) to the broader practices that that we use as a community on collective platforms (see 2.2) and while hosting events (see 2.3).

This means that questions of access are tied to how people read the guides as well as their ability to participate the project and the community more broadly. Participation in _The Turing Way_ itself can be defined broadly, but doing so often requires navigating a number of different platforms (such as Github, Slack, and others) and languages that may be not be native to the participant. In each of these practices, we aim to facilitate access in a broad sense through:

1. **Removing barriers**: We actively advocate for and employ tactics that seek to remove barriers for any current or future participants in our community. This may include people who historically have been limited or structurely excluded from participating in through educational, geographical, linguistic, or technical barriers.
2. **Sharing openly and with openness**: We aim to draft, write, review, and edit our open access guides using open source practices, and we do this in order to enable people from a broad range of backgrounds to get involved in the project.
3. **Supporting inclusive participation**: We acknowledge that openness alone does not make a project accessible in a broad sense, and we are committed to maintaing a socio-technical infrastructure that enables inclusive participation more broadly. This includes hosting spaces for contribution, documenting our practices, and actively gathering feedback.

The practices and policies listed here relate to these three operating principles, which shape how we work within the community to enable access on the web, on our community platforms, and while planning events.

### 2.1 Web Accessibility

_The Turing Way_ is committed to ensuring the web accessibility of our guides.

As an open source community that relies on  projects and platforms for our underlying infrastructure, we acknowledge that we are limited in what standalone access-centered support we can offer. Our project is built with JupyterBook and using the Github platform. Both of these platforms have policies that address how they address the [W3C WAI's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/). You can read more about the JupyterBook's work around accessibility [here](https://astrobites.org/2023/06/10/notebooks-for-all/) and about Github's work [here](https://accessibility.github.com/).

As a community however, we are committed to ensuring broader accessibility of our resources through using this infrastructure through:
- Choosing sufficient color contrast in our hand-drawn images that make our images accessible in the context of color-blindness
- Using and employing appropriate and relevant alt text (also known as 'alternative text') for all of our images, charts, and data visualisations (an ongoing project with in the community)
- Navigation without the need for a mouse or track pad during either the reading process on JupyterBook and/or contributing process on Github

### 2.2 Community Platform Accessibility

_The Turing Way_ is committed to ensuring our accessibility as a community on all the platforms we use.

In our Community Handbook, we describe these practices more specifically and in more details. But as a baseline, our community is dedicated to enabling access in the process of creating 
- Providing diverse opportunities and platforms for people to contribute to _The Turing Way_ despite d
- Setting standards for writing and contribution that understand the way in which language may exclude as well as include people

### 2.3 Community Event Accessibility

As a community

- - Supplying and recording transcripts for audio and closed captioning of video content

### 3.1 How we work with Access-related Feedback

Gathering access-related feedback is integral for ensuring that we Access-related feedback may be submitted via this anonymised form.

1. Feedback form
2. Drop-in sessions - 3x a year: drop-in session to receive feedback aabuout access related different parts of project. Discussion of practices
3. Direct email to RCM with feedback for 1:1
4. Drop by Accessibility Working Group meeting -> can focus on feedback

Feedback is taken to monthly meeting with chairs of working groups & project leadership.

## Core Principles
1. We do these accessibility practices to remove barriers for people who historically have been limited in their ability to participate in because these projects benefit everyone
2. Openness is a means to enable people with broad backgrounds to get involved. Openness for openness' sake does that erase this fact.
3. Access to commons is a question of management - developing a collective commons is 


## How we work with Access-related Feedback

It is important for us to 
Access-related feedback may be submitted via this anonymised form, which .

During community forums like Collaboration Cafes and Fireside Chat, feedback forms are shared during and after these events in order to gage immediate feedback about this event. 

    Timeline (As of 07.2023)

    Who & how to report access

    Our defining process:

    Accessibility WG - is this the committee that will evaluating access-related feedback?

    Infrastructure WG - is this the group that wil be responsible for creating or enabling infrastructure?

    Escalation --> to funders, PIs, co-leads

## Confidentiality

All reports will be kept confidential. If. If submitted through another portal, when we discuss incidents and feedback, we will anonymize details as much as we can to protect reporter privacy. In some cases we may determine that a public statement will need to be made. If that’s the case, the identities of all victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.
