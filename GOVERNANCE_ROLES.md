# Governance Roles in _The Turing Way_

Governance in *The Turing Way* occur across three institutional levels as discussed in the [governance chapter](https://book.the-turing-way.org/foreword/governance).

This document provides details about the governance roles and members collaborating across all levels of governance in _The Turing Way_.

This document also lists the members of the project delivery team, who support community management, maintenance of _The Turing Way_ resources and delivery of the project goals.

For overview of how members of *The Turing Way* community collaborate across these three levels of governance, please refer to the [Ways of Working](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/ways_of_working.md) documentation.

## Participation and Engagement at Community Level

The “Community level" ("Operational-level”) participation influence the everyday decisions and actions made by community members such in participating in the community and contributing to the book.
Expectations and responsibilities for all members, including Code of Conduct, Contributing Guidelines and Acknowledgements, have been provided and maintained in [_The Turing Way_ Community Handbook](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/community-handbook).

All contributors to _The Turing Way_ are listed as [Contributors in the README file](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way?tab=readme-ov-file#contributors) and invited to optionally share narrative details in the [contributors.md](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/contributors.md).

Information from these base files are also published as the [Contributors Record](https://book.the-turing-way.org/afterword/contributors-record) in the afterwards of the book.

Please refer to the Foreword of the book to learn about different kinds of [community roles](https://book.the-turing-way.org/foreword/community).

## Maintenance Level Roles

The "Maintenance" (“Collective choice") level participation allow different groups of people to come together to work on and promote specific area/initiative in the project as well as define/change process to make operational level participation easier.
Please read [Ways of Working document](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/ways_of_working.md) for community structure, commitments and resources used by members at maintenance level.

## Representation at Constitution Level Steering Committee

The "Constitutional-level" participation in Steering Committee by community leaders allow development, approval and establishment of Working Group and project-related norms that affect the whole of the project, community and their sustainability.

Please read [Ways of Working document](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/ways_of_working.md) for community structure, commitments and resources used by members at maintenance level, which also apply to constitution level.
Specific governance documentation and processes for this level will be developed with the founding members of the Steering Committee in 2025.

Chairs or a designated representative of the following **Working Groups** (WGs) join the Steering Committee at this level:

- Community Management WG
- Infrastructure WG
- Book Dash WG
- Accessibility WG
- Translation and Localisation WG

Leads or designated representatives of the **Delivery Teams** for the following projects within _The Turing Way_ also serve on the Steering Committee for accountability:

- **_The Turing Way_ Practitioners Hub**, a Turing-Way project under the Innovate UK BridgeAI that engages with industries in sharing and adopting best practices for data science and AI.
- **Software Sustainability Institute Fellows Projects**, that are defined to be conducted in collaboration with _The Turing Way_ project delivery or community members.
- **JupyterHub -_The Turing Way_ Project**: [Arielle to add details]
- **Data Science Without Borders** (DSWB), a Wellcome Trust-funded project that leverages _The Turing Way_ for adopting and sharing best practices with the DSWB community.
