You should cite research objects from others directly in the paper in places where it is relevant.
This is a commonly practised way of citing other people's work (such as publications) and is valid for citing other research components like data and software.
A citation includes the following information:
- Author
- Title
- Year of publication
- Publisher (for data, this is often the data repository where it is housed)
- Version (if indicated)
- Access information (a URL or DOI)

Like a regular citation, citing a research object is done in a specific citation style. 
A citation style is a specific arrangement, order and formatting of information necessary for a citation.
For instance, the MLA style was developed by Modern Language Association (originally used in the humanities) and the APA style was developed by American Psychological Association (originally used in psychology and the social sciences). 
A specific citation style may also be requested by the journal you are publishing in.
- MLA citation style uses the following format:
`Author. "Title of the Source." Title of the Container, Other contributors, Version, Number, Publisher, Publication date, Location.`
- APA citation style uses the following format:
`Author. (Year). Title of data set (Version number). [Retrieved from] ***OR*** [DOI]`
