# Community Share-outs

Community share-outs are a type of event that are focused on sharing and celebrating the work of contributors. 

They were first planned in the specific context of Book Dash, our community's bi-annual contribution event. On the last day of the Book Dash, _The Turing Way_ team along with the planning committee members host Community Share-out and Contributor Celebration sessions that are open to the public. The Community Share-out events provide a public platform to openly recognise the work of our attendees and community contributors throughout the Book Dash week.

For more information, read the {ref}`Book Dash <ch-bookdash-events>` subchapter.
