# Community Share-outs

On the last day of the Book Dash, The Turing Way team along with the planning committee members host Community Share-out and Contributor Celebration sessions that are open to the public. The Community Share-out events provide a public platform to openly recognise the work of our attendees and community contributors throughout the Book Dash week.
