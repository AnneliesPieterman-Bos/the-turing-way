# Open Governance Forum

Starting in 2024, The Turing Way delivery team is hosting public community calls that bring together different stakeholders, community members and leaders from across the project.

These calls will serve as a platform for the community to come together, share accomplishments, and discuss governance-related matters. 

## Motivation for Organisation

_The Turing Way_ open governance forum was organised in response (and replacing) the Core Team Meetings, which were organised from June 2022 to September 2023. The evolving needs (and reason for sunsetting) the {ref}`Core Team Meetings<ch-community-calls-core-team>` is documented in the relevant subchapter.

More specifically, these calls are designed to be open, public forums to engage in community updates across the project teams and groups, specifically as places to share-out updates at the working group and constitutional levels of the project.

## Format of call

The current format of the call is as follows, and will likely evolve as the community needs evolve alongside them.
