# Core Team Meetings

```{admonition} Note
:class: tip
These calls were organised every three months from June 2022 to September 2023. While these calls have been retired during the 2024 year (in favor of open community calls related to governance), this documentation has been added for archival and transparency purposes.
```

The core team call was initiated to formalise different parts of _The Turing Way_ project and community, as well as initiate the process of decentralised decision-making and governance within the project that went beyond the guides specifically to other types of work. 

This chapter also documents this evolution and reason for retiring this call below. 

## Motivation behind organising

These calls were initiated by the Research Community Manager (in 2022, then Anne Lee Steele) in June 2022 in order to formalise, recognise, and celebrate specialised work and/or roles within the project. At the time, this included volunteers to the project across institutions internationally, as well as employees of the Alan Turing Institute based in the United Kingdom, specifically those based in the Tools, Practices and Systems (TPS) Programme which hosts _The Turing Way_ project. 

## Evolution of call

_The development of working groups within the project has operated in parallel with the "Core Team meeting". This process will be detailed more fully in another chapter within the Community Handbook._

The first two core team meetings in June 2022 and September 2022 focused on the formalisation of the team as the "Core Team" of _The Turing Way_.

In June 2022, the types of work being formalised within the project was related to Translation and Localisation (which had begun in prior years). Simultaneously, the Turing's TPS team had also expanded significantly with Research Application Manager (RAM), Research Community Manager (RCM), and Research Project/Programme Managers (RPMs) roles whose contributions to the project were not clear, though written into their job descriptions. At this call, the proposal was made to trial working groups within the project under three themes: authors & reviewers, infrastructure maintainers, and trainers and mentors – formalising streams of work that already existed in the project, following the translation and localisation process. This call announced a trial, and a call for volunteers from the existing core team to iterate on the format in the following months.

These three working groups were incubated and began to meet and self-organise in the following months. In September 2022, the second "core team" meeting was organised to receive feedback from participants about the process of organising formally as working groups, as opposed to informally as different initiatives. [Feedback was collected](https://hackmd.io/@turingway/working-group-feedback) about the process of working groups at this call, identifying the need for personnel and organisational support, as well as projects of (i.e. transition from github repository to organisation, website and url, and other needs). 

At the January and March 2023 core team calls, drafts were shared about the status of governance within the project – documenting the status of different working groups. Around this time, work around accessibility began to formalise within the project. The "reviers and editors" and "trainers and mentors" working groups were retired, while the "infrastructure maintainers" (which became the Infrastructure WG) was continued. We also created our [first annual report](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZAwCe9hZCG-sntZgIKhfT5G8P0JWFDCK6Di7dde5OII/edit#slide=id.g20fd97d2008_0_0).

At the June 2023 core team meeting, further formalisation was done. An "accessibility working group" had solidified in the previous months (April 2023), in partnership and with volunteers from Metadocencia, while the "infrastructure" and "translation and localisation" were consolidating their work. The Infrastructure WG lead on the transition to the  

At the September 2023 core team meeting, feedback was shared explicitely about decision-making within the project.

## Format of call

During the period of organising core team calls, the format was iterated on a few times. This was to account for the evolving nature of the team.

## Reasons for retiring

_Last updated: February 2024_

These calls were retired in early 2024 due to changes in the governance structure of _The Turing Way_ project. The reformated call centers a public "forum"-style call over the format of closed meeting space.

1. **The boundaries of the "core" team were not well defined from the beginning** 

These calls were initiated during a period of significant growth for _The Turing Way_ community and for the TPS team at the Turing, all of which were grouped under the category of "Core Team" of The Turing Way. While these two persona types (employee of the Alan Turing Institute and volunteer contributors to TTW) were broad, their needs and dynamics were different due to team and line management responsibilities. This lead to questions like:

- (For ATI employees): Do volunteers engage with the core team meeting as representing their role, or as a representative of their team? How did line management affect this responsibility? 
- (For volunteers): How
- (For both): What was the "responsibility" of a core team member of _The Turing Way_? 

The lack of clarity on "who" was a part of the core team reinforced the question of who was accountable for facilitating contributions or contributing directly to _The Turing Way_ project. This "core team" call – in trying to address the needs of both of these groups, created a deadlock in decision-making, which generally.

2. **The purpose of call evolved**

These calls were initiated as a process of formalisation within _The Turing Way_ community. Even the act of gathering diverse participants from the project was initially identified as a need within the project.

As the community continued to grow significantly throughout 2022 and 2023 with new work packages and projects, the core team of the project that met at these calls grew alongside this, as did the need to address blocks for decision-making within the community. This call, while it assembled community leaders from across the project, was identified to be a closed space (i.e. the call was not open to observers from the wider community) as well as a
