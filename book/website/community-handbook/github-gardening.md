# GitHub Gardening

Instructions and information for gardenersâ€¦

## Guiding principles

- Upskill contributors, teaching them best practices
- Be a mentor
- Be a human
- You are not "GitHub police"

## GitHub item purpose

### Issues

- An issue is a task
    - Of a reasonable size for one person (or, a list of sub-issues)
    - Which has a clear "definition of done"

### Discussions

- Items for discussion (not necessarily tied to action or implementation)
- General questions
- Ideas

### PRs

- A proposal to merge one branch into another
    - Marked as a draft if it is work in progress
    - Marked as ready to review if you feel it is ready to be merged

## Gardening stages

These stages correlate roughly with how _mature_ an item is.
It isn't a law, but is intended to help us understand what stage an item is at and what we should be aiming to do to help contributors at each stage.

## Sowing

Initial actions to ensure an item has the best chance of success

## Fertilising

Working on active items to help push them over the line

## Pruning

Closing items which have gone stale

## Glossary

Stale issue
: A stale issue is


## Checklists

### Issues

Always leave a welcoming, friendly message to explain what you are doing and why

#### Sowing

- [ ] Is this an issue
    - [ ] Move to a discussion if this is a discussion
    - [ ] If there is no definition of done
        - Ask if we can find one
        - Move to a discussion(?)
        - Close as unfixable
- [ ] Is this issue in the correct repository
- [ ] Assign appropriate labels
- [ ] Tag (or assign) relevant community members

#### Fertilising

- Ensuring issue is "in action"
    - [ ] Post in the issue
        - Is anyone working on the issue, has anyone been assigned? 
        - What support does the contributer need to fix the issue?
    - [ ] Suggest actions
        - Invite to post a Slack message
        - Invite to collaboration cafe
        - Link with another community member

#### Pruning

- If the issue is stale (we should define stale) - I would hope we could automate at least some of this section
    - If there is no stale label
        - [ ] Mark as stale and leave a message
    - If there is a stale label and x days have passed
        - [ ] Close the issue as stale

### PRs

#### Sowing

- [ ] Is this a PR
- [ ] Assign appropriate labels
- [ ] Convert to "Draft" or "Ready for review" as appropriate
- [ ] Assign reviewers
    Or tag people who may be interested

#### Fertilising

- Getting the PR "over the line"
    - [ ] Reach out to the contributor.
        - How close are they to finished?
        - What support do they need to finish?
        - Do they have the time to complete this PR?
    - [ ] Suggest(?) actions
        - Invite to post a Slack message
        - Invite to collaboration cafe
        - Link with another community member
        - Arrange for someone to adopt the PR

#### Pruning

- Is there a realistic chance this PR will be merged?
  Are the contributors still engaged?
  Is the branch still well in sync with main?
  - [ ] Reach out to draw attention to these issues
  - [ ] Close the PR

:::{warning}
Closing a PR may delete the branch which could result in loss of the commits on that branch.
