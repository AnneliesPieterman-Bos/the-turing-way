# Examples in Action: Case Studies from Developing Existing Pathways

## Case Study: Empowering Communities Through Collaborative Pathway Curation

**Introduction:**

This case study examines two distinct yet complementary approaches to curating learning pathways within the data science domain, highlighting the power of community engagement and focused thematic workshops. The experiences of the Data Science Without Borders (DSWB) pathway and the Software Citation pathway offer valuable insights into effective strategies for identifying learning needs, leveraging existing resources, and fostering community ownership in educational content development.

### Case 1: Data Science Without Borders (DSWB) - Community-Driven Curation

The DSWB pathway exemplifies a bottom-up approach to curriculum development, driven by the direct needs and expertise of its community members. Recognizing the diverse backgrounds and project requirements within the DSWB network (spanning over three countries and involving four technical partners), the curation process prioritized inclusivity and relevance.

**Methodology:**

The curation of the DSWB pathway followed a structured, iterative process:

1.  **Community Brainstorming and Needs Identification:** The process began by engaging all DSWB community members. They were tasked with reviewing the comprehensive content of the Turing Way book, a collaborative, open-source guide to reproducible research. The goal was to identify chapters that held direct relevance and utility for their ongoing work. This initial identification of needs was facilitated through coworking sessions and working group meetings, fostering a collaborative environment for sharing perspectives.

2.  **Initial Chapter Selection and GitHub Integration:** Based on the community's input, a preliminary set of potentially valuable chapters was compiled and documented on a dedicated GitHub page. This platform provided a transparent and accessible space for further review and feedback.

3.  **Community Review and Prioritization:** The curated list of chapters was then shared back with the DSWB community for a second round of evaluation. Members were specifically asked to comment on each chapter, indicating whether it should be retained or removed based on its relevance to current projects and immediate learning needs. A crucial criterion for retention was the chapter's immediate applicability. Chapters deemed potentially useful in the future but not currently required were, by community consensus, slated for removal with the possibility of later reintegration. This focus on immediate need ensured the pathway remained lean and highly relevant.

4.  **Feedback Integration and Finalization:** The feedback received on GitHub was carefully considered, with all comments and suggestions taken into account. Future recommendations for content were also noted for potential inclusion at a later stage. Following this review process, a pull request was made to merge the finalized DSWB pathway into the main Turing Way book, signifying community ownership and integration of the curated content.

**Outcomes and Insights:**

The DSWB pathway curation process yielded several key insights:

* **Community as Experts:** Empowering the community to identify their own learning needs resulted in a highly relevant and targeted pathway.
* **Iterative Feedback Loops:** Multiple rounds of review and feedback ensured that the final content directly addressed the community's requirements.
* **Focus on Immediacy:** Prioritizing currently needed content enhanced the pathway's utility and prevented information overload.
* **Open and Transparent Process:** Utilizing GitHub facilitated collaborative review and fostered a sense of ownership within the community.

### Case 2: Software Citation - Thematic Workshop for Focused Content Development

In contrast to the broad, community-driven approach of the DSWB pathway, the Software Citation pathway employed a focused, workshop-based methodology to address a specific thematic challenge within the research community.

**Methodology:**

The development of the Software Citation pathway centered around a dedicated workshop, strategically timed before the Research Software Funders Forum. The proposal for this initiative was collaboratively developed by a team of experts and stakeholders.

**Problem Statement:** Researchers and authors face a significant challenge due to the scattered and inconsistent guidance available on research software sharing. Information is often dispersed across numerous websites of libraries, journals, research groups, and organizations, lacking a unified and clear set of instructions tailored to researchers' needs. This absence of a common reference point creates confusion and hinders the adoption of best practices in software citation and preservation.

**Solution:** The proposed solution involves the establishment of a central, community-driven website, Cite.Software (domain secured), dedicated to providing clear and consistent guidance on research software preservation and citation. The content for this website will be initially drawn from the Turing Way's Handbook and The Netherlands eScience Center's FAIR software recommendations. The development of user-friendly instructions for researchers will be led by the Turing Way and The Netherlands eScience Center, working in close collaboration with key stakeholders involved in research software preservation and citation. Hosting the website on GitHub (or a similar platform) will ensure transparency, facilitate collaborative contributions from stakeholders, and ultimately engage the wider research community.

**Workshop Agenda:** The Cite.Software workshop was structured to facilitate discussion, gather input, and define next steps:

* Cite.Software Overview (Chris)
* Software at PLoS/Survey (Lauren)
* Break
* Turing Way Software Content/Approach (Malvika)
* eScience Center & the Research Software Directory (Maaike)
* Software Management Plans (Maaike for Maria)
* Discussion & Next Steps

**Outcomes and Insights:**

The workshop-based approach for the Software Citation pathway highlighted the effectiveness of:

* **Targeted Thematic Focus:** Concentrating on a specific challenge allowed for in-depth discussion and the development of a focused solution.
* **Stakeholder Engagement:** Bringing together key individuals and organizations ensured diverse perspectives and buy-in.
* **Leveraging Existing Resources:** Building upon the content of the Turing Way and FAIR software recommendations provided a strong foundation.
* **Collaborative Development:** The workshop format fostered collaboration and the co-creation of the proposed solution.

**Conclusion:**

Both the DSWB and Software Citation pathways demonstrate valuable strategies for creating effective learning resources. The DSWB pathway underscores the power of community-led initiatives in identifying and addressing diverse learning needs through an iterative and inclusive process. The Software Citation pathway highlights the efficacy of focused workshops in tackling specific challenges by engaging key stakeholders and leveraging existing knowledge.

The collaborative and iterative approaches employed in these examples emphasize the importance of community involvement and targeted engagement in curating learning pathways. By empowering communities to define their needs and actively contribute to content development, and by strategically convening stakeholders to address specific thematic areas, we can create more relevant, engaging, and ultimately more effective learning experiences for the data science community. The lessons learned from these initiatives can be applied to future pathway development efforts, fostering a more engaged and empowered data science community.
