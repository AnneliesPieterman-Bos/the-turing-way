## Hosted videos

If your video is hosted on a platform like YouTube or Vimeo you can use the `iframe` directive to embed it.
For example,

{iframe} https://www.youtube.com/embed/MdOS6tPq8fc

renders as,

{iframe} https://www.youtube.com/embed/MdOS6tPq8fc

and can be referenced with `[](#example-video)` [](#example-video).
