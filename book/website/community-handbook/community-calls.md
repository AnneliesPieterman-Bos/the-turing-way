# _The Turing Way_ Community Calls

_The Turing Way_ community is distributed around the world.
Our members are from diverse backgrounds, different skills and interests, working many different jobs, and contribute to this project for a great variety of reasons. They are also, for the most part, unpaid to contribute to this open source project.

To bring the community together, _The Turing Way_ has a variety of different community calls organised throughout the year. These calls may vary from collaboration and working calls, to organisational meetings, to public share-outs that demonstrate transparency, to a mixture of all of the above. Due to the international nature of the project, these calls are generally organised online using a platform such as Zoom.

On each page of this subchapter, you can learn more about each type of community call, which are roughly organised into four types: community coworking calls, organising and governance calls, onboarding and welcoming calls, and public celebration calls. 

It is important to note that not all of our community calls fit neatly in one category over another. Some may mix practices and purposes (i.e. for coworking as well as celebrations), while others may have a specific purpose (i.e. for decision-making). All are meant to demonstrate our principles of being an open and transparent community.

Because of their scope and size, the {ref}`Book Dash<ch-bookdash>` and {ref}`Fireside Chat series<ch-fireside-chat>` are documented separately. However, those calls overlap with many of the principles and practices shared in this community calls chapter.

## 1. Coworking calls

**Community calls**: {ref}`Weekly Coworking<ch-community-calls-coworking>`, {ref}`Collaboration Cafe<ch-community-calls-collabcafe>`

The concept of coworking is generally associated with the practice of sharing physical office space with different people who work independently such as remote employees or freelancers.
This allows people, who otherwise may feel isolated while working alone at home, to use traditional office setups, create a work routine, and build a sense of companionship with others who they share their office spaces with.

We bring the practice of coworking to _The Turing Way_ using online coworking calls, through which we intend to develop a sense of energy and inspiration similar to in-person interactions but without the time and travel commitments.

Our coworking calls provide opportunities for community members to allocate time to their desired tasks in _The Turing Way_ and get them done, partially or fully, with the support of others in the call who can help discuss their plans, share ideas or hold accountability.

## 2. Organising and Governance Meetings

**Community calls**: {ref}`Core Team Meetings (now retired)<ch-community-calls-core-team>`, {ref}`Open Governance Calls<ch-community-calls-open-governance>`

Community calls may also be used at spaces for organising and planning within _The Turing Way_ community for goverance purposes. As the community has grown tremendously (over 450 contributors and 30+ core team members as of February 2024), it has increasingly become clear that formalised decision-making and structures are needed to ensure the sustainability of the project.

These calls may take on a more traditional meeting format, with a prepared agenda with particular points to be voted on by different members. Alternatively, it could also take on a more decentralised format that is aimed at gathering feedback from the organising body of the project, and or relay feedback from the Maintainer level to the Constitutional level of the project (see: [Liberating Structures](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/)). 

In principle, these organising and governance meetings are still open for all to attend from the community as observers.

## 3. Share-out and Celebration calls

**Community calls**: {ref}`Community Share-outs<ch-community-calls-shareouts>`, {ref}`Collaboration Cafes<ch-community-calls-collabcafe>`, {ref}`Open Governance Calls<ch-community-calls-open-governance>`

Some of our calls are oriented around sharing work that has been completed by community members over. This is particularly the case during Book Dash, where community members work on specific projects like chapter additions, editing existing chapters, infrastructure maintenance, documenting access-related practices, translating a chapter, and more.

In the Collaboration Cafes, there is generally time reserved at the end of the call to celebrate and share discussions from two-hour session.

## 4. Onboarding and Welcoming calls

**Community calls**: {ref}`Office Hours (now retired)<ch-community-calls-office-hours>`, {ref}`Onboarding Calls<ch-community-calls-onboarding>`

As the project and community has grown, the need for spaces within the community that are beginner-friendly has become all the more important. Onboarding and welcoming calls are community calls that are oriented aroun we

We want to make collaborative events like these as useful as possible for as many people as possible.
Please [let the team members know](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way#get-in-touch) if there are other ways we can make these calls more welcoming and helpful for you.
