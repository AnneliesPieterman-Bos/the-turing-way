# Research Community Manager Personal Story

## Introduction - tell us about your background and how you became a RCM?
My name is [Dr Emma Karoune](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/research-associates/emma-karoune) and I'm currently a Senior Researcher focusing on Research Community Building at The Alan Turing Institute. I joined the Turing at the start of 2021 to be a Research Community Manager for a Covid-19 research project. At this time, this role was new at Turing and I could not actually be called a RCM so my job title was Research Associate. 

Before I joined the Turing, I did quite a few different types of roles in and out of academia and I think this varied experience, and the skills I have learnt along the way, make me ideal for the varied and broad work of RCM roles. I started my academic career as an Archaeobotanists (an archaeologists that specialises in plant remains) with a PhD from the Institute of Archaeology, University College London. In my PhD, I did a replication study of someone elses identification method, and quiet unsurprisingly!, I found it could not be replicated accurately. This sparked my interest in open research. At the time of finishing my PhD, there were not any academic opportunities for me, so I trained to be a high school science teacher and worked in education in various roles for about 10 years. I then started to come back into academia and focus on open research. I've led community open research projects, such as the FAIR Phytoliths Project at Historic England, and I lead a community called Open Phytoliths that is striving to bring open research practices into this discipline (phytolith research) and also more widely in related disciplines such as Archaeology and Palaeoecology. I also work with other open research communities such as OLS, Software Sustainability Institute and ELIXIR. 

Since working at the Turing, I have worked across different health data science projects, with interest groups and I now work closely with the Turing Skills Team on data science skills related research and community projects. 

I very much see myself now as a generalist with lots of transferable skills that can be applied in any research domain and I really enjoy the challenge of working in multiple disciplines. 


## Embedding RCM at Turing
At Turing, I joined the Institute when there was only one other RCM, the wonderful Malvika Sharan working on the Turing Way. Malvika then established the RCM team at Turing and we have worked together to grow the team and put in place processes and resources for setting up research communities for Turing projects. The RCM team now has 10 members and we work across the Turing on multiple projects and programmes. 


## Challenges
As the RCM role is fairly new in research (they are frequently found in open source and gaming communities), 


## Benefits




## Do you have any top tips for other people that might be interested in  working as an RCM?
