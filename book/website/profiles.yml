    Early Career Researchers (ECRs) are students, PhDs and early-stage postdocs
    who may not have a lot of experience in contributing to research projects
    from start to finish. This curated set of chapters will allow them to
    understand what best practices apply at different stages of development to
    ensure research reproducibility.

    Project leaders are people who are responsible for project planning,
    resource allocation and other decision-making for and with the involvement
    of their project team. This curated set of chapters will point them to
    relevant tools and practices that they can use for managing their projects
    while ensuring transparency, reproducibility, collaboration and ethical
    practices throughout the lifecycle of research.

    From research to government, every sector strongly relies upon the use of
    research software. This curated set of chapters guides the sharing and
    citation of software components from source code to computational workflows
    and executables while attributing all contributors fairly.

    For effective collaboration among international teams, 
    such as in the Data Science Without Borders project, 
    it is essential to learn, adopt, and implement best practices 
    in open, reproducible, ethical, and inclusive data science. 
    These curated chapters will provide starting points, helping 
    you navigate a broader set of practices in The Turing Way.
