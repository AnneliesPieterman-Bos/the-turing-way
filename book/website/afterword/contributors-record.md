# Record of Contributions

```{note}
This page is formed from a combination of the [`contributors.md`](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/contributors.md) file and the contributor's table in the [`README file`](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way#contributors). Pulling these files together into this page requires a little infrastructure wizardry under the hood, which you can read about in the section on {ref}`ch-infrastructure-contributors`.
